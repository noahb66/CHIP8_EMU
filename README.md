# CHIP8_EMU
Chip8 emulator made for practice

I worked through this as an educational project. This was my first project using C language as well as my first stint into SDL. 
Because of that many a good sources were used

This one being a massive help as I used it to kind of skeleton the project. 
It was what I used to load the roms and get SDL to work properly so thank you! Obviously a lot of my code is similar and well....thank you.
